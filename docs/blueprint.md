# **App Name**: Bruch Challenge Hub

## Core Features:

- Recent Challenges: Display recent Bruch Challenges with links to their detail pages. The challenges should be listed in reverse chronological order.
- Challenge Details: Display details of past challenges, including games played, objectives, outcomes (wins/losses), and total time. Import and display the data from previous challenges listed in the original request.
- Challenge Countdown: Display a countdown timer for the next scheduled challenge.
- Challenge Creation (Admin): Enable admins to create new challenges by specifying games and their objectives, and schedule the challenge with a specific date and time.
- Live Challenge Updates: During a live challenge, display real-time updates of game status (wins/losses, time elapsed). Allow the admin to add active game buttons, so a timer for each game can be seen and to log break times. Make the page visible to the general public to keep tabs on progress.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to evoke a sense of energy and competition, representing the high-stakes nature of the challenges.
- Background color: A light gray (#F0F0F0) creates a clean and modern look, providing contrast to the blue primary color and making the content easily readable.
- Accent color: A lively orange (#FF9933), is used sparingly for key interactive elements like buttons and timers, drawing the user's attention to important information and actions.
- Clean and readable sans-serif font for all text elements, ensuring clarity and ease of reading, even during fast-paced updates.
- Use game-themed icons to represent each game in the challenge. Simple and recognizable icons to enhance visual communication.
- Use a dynamic and responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring the website is accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Subtle animations on status changes and countdown timers, providing visual feedback without being distracting. The live status page features small animations for timer and score changes to add visual excitement.
